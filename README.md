draGGradients
=============

A simple tool to generate and customize multiple css3 radial gradients.

I get back an old project that uses a multiple gradient jpg image as a background and started to generate the same image in css-only. Instead of code only this image I finished doing [this](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/draGGradients/) little stuff.

##### How to use it?
Toggle main controls clicking the cog-icon on the up-right corner (also pressing ESC key) to customize, add and arrange each point generator.

Basically the tool works generating radial-gradients from each draggable point, and you could control:<br>
- __The main color.__ Wrinting any valid (rgba, rgb, hex, html, etc) color type or picking one from the colorPicker.
- __The position.__ Dragging each point in the canvas.
- __The deep.__ Sliding or changing the value, you could set the percentage of each radial-gradient.<br>

You could also __add__, __delete__ and __arrange__ each point from the same section.

In the bottom left menu, you could:
- __Toggle points.__ Switch on/off the points from the main view.
- __Change background.__ It modifies the last child of the gradient that works as background.
- __Generate random.__ Clicking on the shuffle-icon.
- __Presets__ from [uigradients](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients/blob/master/gradients.json) by Indrashish Ghosh.

Of course you could __copy the generated code__ clicking the _code-icon_ and __generate a pen__ clicking on _Codepen icon_
